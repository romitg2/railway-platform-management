# RailWay-Platform-Management

Railway is one of the most important system of our country. To effectively manage the timetable and allocate the platform, we need to consider so many factors.

**->** While allocating the platforms, we need to consider the timings of the trains so they donâ€™t face any clashes. For example, if any train comes before the previous trainâ€™s departure, then we need to allocate that train, another platform. 

**->** Another problem is accommodation. If the length of the train is greater than the platform length, then we cannot allocate that platform to that train. Bidirectional railway line is a system which allows to run the trains in both the directions. Such platforms have capacity to accommodate more than one train on a single line. They contain loops and junction to change their lines during arriving or departure. Advantage is, we can reduce the cost of construction and maintenance. It also require a very accurate management of allocation. We are going to solve such problems in our project work.

Overall, the project railway platform management aims to create an efficient, safe, and passenger-friendly environment on railway platforms. By leveraging technology, optimizing operations, and prioritizing passenger experience, it seeks to enhance the overall railway transportation system and improve the satisfaction of commuters.

## Flow

**->** Here we will take total number of trains as an input.

**->** Then we will take time as a string in the 24 hrs formate (hh:mm).

**->** And finally we will take number of cabins in that train from the user.

**->** So our program will return the platform number for that train as the result.
